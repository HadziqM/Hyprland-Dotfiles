# HYPRLAND DOTFILE

This project dedicated to translate beautiful window manager configuration from `https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles` that run on `BSPWM` into `Hyprland` focusing on the ricing and theme.


## STATUS
 `Incomplete` , there still so much that's need to be done since `BSPWM` run under `X11` ,and i want the configuration, package and dependencies stay same as possible on `Wayland` using an alternative if they doesn't support `Wayland`.

## TODO

- [x] **Add Basic dependencies**,
  Adding basic dependencies that will be required by `Hyprland`
- [ ] **Migrating Script**,
  Migrate the script for running apps, auto start dependencies, path, variable etc.
- [ ] **Add KeyBinds**,
  Add my own keybinds, it will be bit different than `https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles` since i has some `neovim` configuration that use `Vscode` keybinds.
- [ ] **Migrating Polybar to Waybar**,
  Make Waybar running through `Hyprland` and if possible also make `Eww` widget running under Waybar.
- [ ] **Make Notification Api working**,
  Make `Dunst` work under `Hyprland`.
- [ ] **Rice Selector**,
  Make Rice selector work in `Hyprland`, it will use `Rofi` that run on `Xwayland` yet.
- [ ] **Add other dotfiles**,
  Add other dotfile including `zsh`,`nvim`,`yazi` etc.
- [ ] **Add installer script**,
  Add installation script so it can automate installation process, targeting `Arch` clean install and other `Arch` based distro.
